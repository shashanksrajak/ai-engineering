# GEMINI.md: AI Engineering Learning Repository

## Directory Overview

This repository is a collection of educational materials focused on AI engineering. It contains a variety of tutorials, examples, and projects covering topics such as Generative AI, LangGraph, and Natural Language Processing. The content is organized into several directories, each focusing on a specific area of AI.

The primary purpose of this repository is for learning and self-study. It is not a single, unified software project, but rather a curated collection of notebooks and code samples.

## Key Files and Directories

- `README.md`: The main README file, providing a high-level overview of the repository and its structure.
- `genai-course/`: Contains materials for a comprehensive Generative AI course, covering prompt engineering, RAG, vector databases, and agents.
- `langgraph/`: Includes tutorials and examples for LangGraph, a library for building stateful, multi-agent applications.
- `machine-learning/`: A large directory containing a wide range of machine learning topics, from basics to deep learning.
- `pyproject.toml` and `environment.yml`: These files define the Python dependencies for the project, which include common data science and machine learning libraries like `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `torch`, and `jupyter`.
- `*.ipynb`: The repository is rich with Jupyter notebooks that provide interactive tutorials and examples.

## Usage

The contents of this directory are intended for educational purposes. Users can explore the different directories and notebooks to learn about various AI engineering concepts. The notebooks are self-contained and include both code and explanations.

To run the notebooks, you will need to have a Python environment with the dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml` or `environment.yml` installed. You can use a tool like `pip` or `conda` to install these dependencies.

# Rules

- All new docs should be created in `/docs` directory and prefer `makrdown` files.
